    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li> 

        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>

        <li>1 ¼ cups finely ground almond flour </li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
<br>

    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously spray or brush a nonstick donut pan with cooking spray; set aside until needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place eggs, vegetable oil, and maple syrup into a mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly until the mixture is emulsified, light, and a little bit 
            foamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add almond flour, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder; mix everything together thoroughly with a spatula until all the 
            almond flour is incorporated and you've achieved a very thick batter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer batter into a pastry bag, or a plastic zip-top bag with one of the corners cut off. Pipe the batter evenly into the prepared donut pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dip a finger in water and smooth the tops of the batter to even out. Tap the pan on a work surface a few times to settle the batter even more. </p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a wooden skewer inserted into a donut comes out clean, 9 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire cooling rack. Cool completely before serving. </p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your Almond Chocolate Donuts with icing and some more maple syrup</p>
